1.  Run "train.py" to train a model on the Housing dataset

2.  Set "num_clusters" in "vertices.py" and then run it 
-  Hit return after selecting a cluster (it should clear the markers)
-  Close the plotting window after selecting "num_clusters" clusters (it won't close on its own)

3.  Run "run_sync.ipynb" to visualize the clusters and their explanations
